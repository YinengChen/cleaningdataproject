# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repo contains the following files:

1. run_analysis.R : This is the code for the project.

1. tidyData.txt: this is a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

1. CodeBook.Rmd: The code book describes the variables and the data.

# Data Description

The data were collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 30 volunteers aged from 19 to 48 years were asked to perform six activities wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. For each volunteer, 561 features were recorded. 

# Code explanation

The code was written under the following instruction:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

1. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
